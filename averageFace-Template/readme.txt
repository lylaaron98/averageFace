This file contains a general description of my averageFace application

=======================================================================

Further development ideas:

1) Key pressed upon "SHIFT" key will change the image on the left with a random image from the array

2) Upon mouse cursor movements, the image on the right will reflect a transition of the random image, to the average face of all the images in the array, when the mouse cursor moves from left to right, with the usage of the lerp function.

Additional notes:

- mouse movement for lerp will reset image to img0
